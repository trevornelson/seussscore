Once upon a time, old stories tell us,
There was a duke whose name was Theseus.
Of Athens he was lord and governor,
And in his time was such a conqueror
That none was greater underneath the sun,
So many wealthy countries he had won.
What with his wisdom and his chivalry,
He conquered all the realm of Femeny,
Which then was known as Scythia, and married
The queen named Hippolyta, whom he carried
Back home with him amid much pageantry
And glorious ceremony. Emily,
Her younger sister, also went along.
And so in victory and glorious song
I leave this noble duke as he is bound
For Athens, with his warriors all around.
And if there weren't so much to hear, I now
Would fully have related for you how
That land was won, the realm of Femeny,
By Theseus and by his chivalry;
I'd tell you of the battle that was waged
As Athens and the Amazons engaged,
And of the siege in which was finally seen
Defeat for Scythia's fair and hardy queen,
And of the feast upon their wedding day
And the rousing welcome home. But as I say,
I must forbear describing all that now.
I have, God knows, a lot of field to plow,
The oxen in my yoke have got it rough.
And since the rest of my tale's long enough,
Not holding back the group is my concern;
Let every fellow tell his tale in turn
And let us see who shall the supper win.
