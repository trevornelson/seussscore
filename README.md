**Work Flow**
- Work on separate to-do's in a separate branch for that specific task. This'll make it easier to review/merge all our code.
- When you push your branch up to GitHub, submit a pull request and tag @trevornelson, @danasselin and @kevalwell.
- Don't merge any branches with master on GitHub until everyone's given the branch the thumbs up in the pull request comments.
- Try to isolate the changes you're making in a branch to only what's needed for that branch's to-do.
